<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate (2022.08-) in Computing Information & Science here at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) supervised by Prof. [Weijie Zhao](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~wjz/). My research interests span <b> LLMs, AI Privacy & Security, and Scalable & Trustworthy Machine Learning</b>.

Prior to RIT, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Computer Vision (ICV), Shenzhen University, China, and was supervised by Prof.  [Linlin Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AZ_y9HgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (**Honorary Professor** at the University of Nottingham, UK). Besides, I used to work as a software engineer (intern) at AI Lab of ByteDance inc. (TikTok's Parent Company).

I got the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in July 2021. I was the leader of a project funded byÂ the <b>National Ministry of Education of China</b>Â for undergraduates in 2019. During my period of undergraduate, I received anÂ <b>ACM-ICPC Asia Bronze Medal</b>Â in the ACM-ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contest, and aÂ <b>Silver Medal</b>Â in the ACM-ICPC Shaanxi Province Contest of China.

**Machine Unlearning in Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT)** 
- Propose an unlearning framework that efficiently and effectively unlearns a given collection of data **without retraining** the model from scratch.
- Introduce a collection of techniques, including random split point selection and random partitioning layers training, to the training process of the original tree models to ensure that the trained model requires few subtree retrainings during the unlearning.
- To the best of our knowledge, this is the **first work** that considers machine unlearning on GBDT.
