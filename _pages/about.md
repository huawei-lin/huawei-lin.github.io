<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. Student in Computing Information & Science here at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) supervised by Prof. [Weijie Zhao](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~wjz/). My research interests span <b> Security, Scalable Machine Learning, and Trustworthy Machine Learning</b>.

Prior to RIT, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Computer Vision (ICV), Shenzhen University, China, and was supervised by Prof.  [Linlin Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AZ_y9HgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (**Honorary Professor** at the University of Nottingham, UK). Besides, I used to work as a software engineer (intern) at AI Lab of ByteDance inc. (TikTok's Parent Company).

I got the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in July 2021. I was the leader of a project funded by the <b>National Ministry of Education of China</b> for undergraduates in 2019. During my period of undergraduate, I received an <b>ACM-ICPC Asia Bronze Medal</b> in the ACM-ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contest, and a <b>Silver Medal</b> in the ACM-ICPC Shaanxi Province Contest of China.
